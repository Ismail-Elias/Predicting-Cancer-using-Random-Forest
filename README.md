# Predicting-Cancer-using-Random-Forest
- Predicting type of cell, whether it is benign or malignant and explain the prediction using SHAP.
- The dataset can be loaded using this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/breast_cancer/Training_set_breastcancer.csv
- The predictive model used is Random Forest with minor estimator tweak which give an accuracy of 96%.
- Using SHAP to create force plot to visualize how does the model make prediction.
- Created summary plot to identify the most importance variables
- Created dependency plot to visualize the dependecy of 2 variables in making prediction.
- Some of the plot cannot be viewed in Github, download the notebook to view it.
